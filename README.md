# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study: Payments/Billing

## Overview and Origin
Initially incorporated in Delaware on 09/04/2001, Factor Systems, Inc. (DBA "Billtrust") was re-incorporated in Delaware on 02/28/2019 as BTRS Holdings Inc. On 01/12/2021, BTRS Holdings Inc. and South Mountain Merger Corp. (a Special Purpose Acquisition Company), announced the completion of their business combination. 
Billtrust is a Lawrenceville, New Jersey based publicly traded company (NASDAQ: BTRS & BTRW). Billtrust is a financial technology company within the software-application industry providing cloud-based software and integrated payment processing solutions that simplify and automate B2B commerce. 
Prior to founding Billtrust in 2001, Flint Lane co-founded Paytrust an electronic bill payment and presentment company in 1998. Lane created Paytrust in part from the burden of receiving paper bills. He wanted to create a solution that would move the industry away from paper and to electronic payments. After leaving Paytrust, he recognized a market trend and set out to capitalize on the demand for a B2B payment solution with Billtrust. Lane wanted to help organizations make the transition from paper to electronic billing, and in the early 2000's many of these organizations were unable to do it on their own. Armed with the solution to a problem, they explored how companies would pay for the service. Research led them to the payroll services business model. Lane recognized that companies do not use payroll service companies for just check printing, but for all of the services that go around payroll. Similarly, companies would pay Billtrust to print bills, email bills, fax bills, build an online payment site, and accept payments online. 
Initially, Billtrust marketed their products to smaller companies. However, within a few months they realized that the small number of invoices prevented their customers from recognizing the full cost savings, and efficiency gains potential of Billtrust products. The bottled water industry introduced them to larger industries, and they found a niche with larger segments such as wholesale distribution and manufacturing. Companies operating in these industries process a large number of monthly bills and invoices, which allows them to recognize efficiency gains and cost savings through scale. 
From the humble beginnings of a start-up in 2001, Billtrust has grown significantly in 20 years. The rapid growth can be attributed to both product demand and capital infusions. Prior to its SPAC merger, Billtrust had raised a total of 115 million over seven rounds of funding. In 2006 Billtrust received 4 million in venture capital from Edison Partners. Edison sold their stake in Billtrust in 2018 to W Capital Partners. During those twelve years Billtrust revenue grew 30x, their workforce grew to more than 500 employees and they acquired seven companies. The sale generated a more than 10x return on investment for Edison. Six years later, Billtrust secured a 25 million investment from private equity firm Bain Capital Ventures for strategic acquisitions. 
Billtrust has 565 employees in 22 states, processed more than 30 billion in ACH and Card payments in 2019 for more than 100,000 customers nationwide. For 2020 Billtrust reported a 7% year-over-year increase in total revenues (145.7 million), and a 18% year-over-year increase in software and payments revenue (68.9 million). They expect double digit growth to continue, forecasting total revenues of 159 million to 165 million in 2021. 

## Business Activities:
Billtrust offers solutions that range from credit decisioning and monitoring, online ordering, invoicing, cash application, and collections. Billtrust products are designed to help companies recognize efficiency gains in the invoice-to-cash process with the adoption of payment cycle management. Their cloud-based solution helps to improve customers receivable turnover ratio and accelerate their cash flow by automating invoice delivery, invoice payment, and cash application. Additionally, Billtrust products allow businesses to gain transparency into their accounts receivable processes and increase customer satisfaction rates. Billtrust CEO Flint Lane states that Billtrust strives "to help the B2B industry solve their billing and payments roadblocks. Many companies are still using a paper process that is more expensive, bad for the environment and drives elongated payment cycles. So, whether it’s updating and automating outdated, manual processes that are slowing down cash flow or building an online portal for customers to pay their bills easily and securely, Billtrust assists in overcoming the roadblocks that many A/R departments face every day".
Billtrust has created customized solutions for specific industries – Transportation, Heavy Machinery & Equipment, Distribution, Manufacturing, Medical Equipment & Supplies, Business & Professional Services, and Technology. Their threshold is 1 thousand to 1 million bills per month, which tends to be companies with 50 million in revenue and higher. Their products are viable across industries but they target companies in the mid-market segment and up that have a large number of monthly bills and invoices. 
Slintel.com reports Billtrust has a 0.26% market share in the payments-processing space with customers such as Iron Mountain, Equifax, and Stanley Security. Primary alternatives include Checkout.com (34.71%) and Amazon Payments (8.51%). Checkout.com is a large global company that processes payments in over 150 currencies, with 15 international offices that support thousands of businesses around the world. Both checkout.com and Amazon Payments both focus on the B2C space rather than B2B like Billtrust. Slintel.com also reports Billtrust has a 0.11% market share in the billing and invoicing space. This market share is significantly less than industry leader QuickBooks (16.59%). Billtrust should continue to focus on building their brand and expending domestically while specializing in B2B. Billtrust boasts a 98% customer retention rate, signaling a potential competitive advantage in customer service and satisfaction. 
Billtrust leverages a variety of technologies including machine learning for the credit products. Machine-learning technology is able to quickly ingest and analyze massive amounts of data to identify trends and make very clear, accurate predictions of events in the future. For example, machine-learning algorithms are able to detect patterns that indicate financial distress and predict results that help credit managers protect themselves from extending credit to businesses that may not be able to pay in the future. Billtrust employs machine learning algorithms to manage credit risk and provide accurate indicators that measure a potential customers’ payment outlook and business viability with more than 80% predictive accuracy. 

## Landscape:
Billtrust primarily operates within the B2B Payments/Billing domain of the financial technology industry. B2B payments are financial transactions processed between companies. For example, a payment from Apple Inc. to Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. for an invoice of chips used in Apple products. Or a payment from Qualcomm to semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. While similar to B2C payments, B2B payments have additional processes in place that make them more complex, including volume, reconciliation, terms, and payment methods. 
The B2B Payments/Billing domain has been a disruptive force in the industry and includes many large and well-known companies. Stripe, one of the most popular B2B payment processors, and Braintree both offer transactional pricing of 2.9% plus 0.30 for every payment made through their platform.  Chargify, Recurly, and Chargebee offer tiered pricing that includes a base monthly charge plus a percentage of monthly revenue. These FinTech companies are likely to continue to disrupt the domain and those that can leverage new innovations gaining even larger market share.
Industry trends and technological innovations have, and will continue to change the industry. A significant innovation gaining industry acceptance is cryptocurrencies. The most publicly recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has long had a negative reputation for volatility and the asset of choice for money launderers and terrorism financiers. However, more and more companies now accept Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Today consumers can purchase a Tesla vehicle, Xbox store credits, or food at a Yum Brands restaurant (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bel). As acceptance continues to grow, crypto based currencies appear to be the future of B2B payments.

## Results
Despite having a smaller market share than the larger, and well-funded competitors with the B2B Payments/Billing domain, Billtrust has increased its products, customer base and bottom-line. In 2006 Billtrust received its first external capital investment from Edison Partners. At that time Billtrust served more than 150 companies and reported triple digit growth since inception. 15 years later they employ 565 people, process billions of dollars per year for more than 100,000 customers and continue to report double digit revenue growth. 
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is a core metric that companies in this domain use to measure success. Typically determined on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, DSO is a measure of the average number of days that it takes a company to collect payment for a sale. DSO is calculated by dividing the total number of accounts receivable during a given period by the total value of credit sales during the same period and multiply the result by the number of days in the period being measured. Since cash is vital to any business, reducing a company’s DSO directly effects the financial well-being of the company. 
In a recent whitepaper titled “3 ways to improve DSO with the order-to-cash process”, the Billtrust Data Team analyzed their own payments data to see how fast their customers received online payments using the automated platform. They found that the average DSO from their B2B customers was just 25 days, versus an industry average of 40-50 days. Billtrust states that even reduction of one day of DSO can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual savings. Outperforming the industry average with the DSO metric provides Billtrust customers a competitive advantage.

## Recommendations
Paymentsjournal.com cite The World Bank in estimating that “the average percentage transaction fee for cross-border remittances to be around 6.51% as of Q4 of 2020. The number is even higher for transactions initiated through banks, averaging a whopping 11%”. Additionally, the average cross-border payment can take two to three days to settle. The World Bank also claims that remittance inflows comprise as much as 40% of the GDP for some countries in 2019. The traditional cross-border method leverages correspondent banks to process a transaction, which led to inflated costs and cycle time. 
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that leverages Blockchain technology as a medium of exchange. This technology provides a solution that bypasses traditional cross-border payment intermediaries and offers a secure way to record transactions within a distributed ledger. This technology also reduces fraud risk and stores transaction data on a distributed ledger network which promotes increased consumer data privacy regulation compliance. Paymentsnext.com estimates that cross-border B2B payments will reach 35 trillion dollars in 2022. Many companies are still using traditional methods such as wire transfers which can require remitters to fax paper invoices to recipients. Not only is this inefficient and costly, the risk of fraud and theft of data increases as many people now work from a home office. 
Offering a proprietary “Billtrust Coin”, or the ability to settle payments via existing cryptocurrencies would give Billtrust access to the rapidly growing and lucrative digital cross-border B2B payment market and increase the already double-digit annual growth they have come to enjoy.
